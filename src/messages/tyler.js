                    In my original post about today I cut a lot out cause of my edginess which definitely exists
                    you jerks, I am the shadow to all of your sonics. But after thinking about it I’ve decided to
                    write back up things I said about people. Never speak of this again -_- It’ll be awkwardly and
                    badly worded because I’m bad at speaking and if I forget anyone I haven’t forgotten I’m just
                    REAL bad at words and I’m sorry.

                <p>
                    I know we’ve had a lot of disagreements in the past but I’m really grateful that you, for
                    whatever reason gave me the chance to be owner. And I do genuinely think you’re a good,
                    kind person and I wish you talked more because I actually like when you speak ya know.

                    you always putting on community events for everyone cause I’m always too awkward to try

                    (like pls wipe the images from my eyes), you’re actually really cool and have always been
                    nice to me. Am glad to have been your fake parent lmao.

                    but you’re great and the server is better with you in it. If you ever leave I’m dragging you

                    you make it seem so easy. You check up on me when I seem upset and it always means a
                    lot to me that someone cares. You may like Mikan but you’re real great yeehaw.

                    and although we have had disagreements, you’ve listened to me when I needed and you’re a cool guy so

                    to see you talking when you do. Also you and neel are good together it’s nice seeing you guys making

                    in words cause this document is as good as it gets. Not being edgy is causing me physical
                    pain but it’s alright cause you all deserve to know how great you are. Thanks for sticking with
                    me for a year dorks.

                            Obviously I know you aren't gonna see this and even tho you haven't been here for months something
                            in me still needs to say something about you cause you were here and that matters to me.
                            We had a lot of shit and you really hurt me and messed me up for a good while.
                            But before that you were such a great friend and I really did love you even tho I never told you that.
                            Probably for the best that I never did.
                            Definitely made January one of the better months in my life so I thank you for that and I miss you a lot still lol.
