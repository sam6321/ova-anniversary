                <h1>Nice things about the OVA members</h1>
                Foreword: this might be a long ass document so use ctrl + f to find yourself if you don’t wanna read what I have to say about the others. The people who find themselves on this today list are all people who regularly chat on the OVA (even dash gets complimented). Also, I might have more to say about some than others. Without further ado, I guess we can start.
                <br/><br/>
                Tyler – No matter how much you say you’re not nice, you’re a fucking great person. I know you think we call you a good owner because our previous two owners have not been the best, but you’re active, listen to us and are funny to talk to.
                <br/><br/>
                Cake – Holy shit my guy, I’m honestly real happy the OVA x THFC crossover happened. Again, same as with Ty, you’re nice even if you say you aren’t. I might not know what’s going on behind closed doors, but from my perspective you’re an understanding, kind hearted lad who listens to me vent every once in a while.
                <br/><br/>
                Dash – For as much shit as me and others might give you, you’re an alright person. Talking to you can be kinda fun.
                <br/><br/>
                Dou – You’re a pretty cool lad too. Without you I probably never would’ve taken an interest in MHA and if I did, it’d be way later. You tried to entertain us by setting up servers for MC and TTT (Which went over quite well I would say) and even though I first took you as kind of an asshole, you’re a good person.
                <br/><br/>
                Sayo – Dou’s Spanish brother, the SLAM man himself. As much as you called me a retard, TF2, Payday 2 and other games were pretty fun to play with you. Plus, you’re someone I can gush over MGS to.
                <br/><br/>
                Neel – Again, as much as you might say you’re a piece of shit and think no one wants you around, playing Terraria was fun as fuck with you.
                <br/><br/>
                Vase – As much as I repeat myself in this file, I can talk to you about JoJo for hours if I really wanted to, plus we’re writing the fic so I get to chat to you a bunch more. You’re much nicer than you let on, pottery.
                <br/><br/>
                Mark – Sure, you haven’t been active in the server for a while, but for that time that you were active every day you were a pretty nice person to chat with. You also play the electric guitar, so that’s always a plus in my books.
                <br/><br/>
                Mute – I can gush over MGR, VA-11 HALL-A and other games to you and you’re one of the nicest people I’ve met pretty much ever. Also, it’s nice to have someone I can get angry over TF2 with.
                <br/><br/>
                Supa – Probably nicest person I’ve ever met. You’ve got your moments of getting mad, your life doesn’t seem the best but you still power through the light to moderate suffering life throws at you. Godspeed, you motherfucking legend.
                <br/><br/>
                Cell – Tell me something we haven’t talked about. Music, games, waifus, gym and school seem to be things we often bring up. You’re the one who helped me get the confidence to sign up for the gym, plus you’re really laid back so you’re cool af.
                <br/><br/>
                Snow – Another person who tends to slightly self-deprecate. Also yes I understand I’m a hypocrite for hating people who self-deprecate even though I do it often, but… Snow, you’re genuinely really fucking nice to be around in chat, you and your EYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEY is just too fucking innocent to not have me smile. I also see drawing as a fuckin respectable skill (which I don’t have lmao)
                <br/><br/>
                Zack – You’re our DnD DM and put up with a lot of our party’s shit. From all the times I’ve talked to you in VC you were a pretty cool guy to talk with. Besides, you’re a fellow SHULK MAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN.
                <br/><br/>
                Supp – Warhammer 40K memes, Conet, Britain. These were the ingredients chose- yeah I’ll stop. You’re cool.
                <br/><br/>
                Shao – I don’t know exactly what it is about you, but apart from you being really fucking cool, you make me go ‘’HOLY SHIT ITS MY NIGGA BAOLINBUNK’’ whenever you show up, so you’re here too.
                <br/><br/>
                Kray – Fucking awesome person to talk to, really cool to see him talk about history and shit
                <br/><br/>
                Dee – As much as you’re called gay by literally everyone, you put up with my shitty ass coding skills enough for me to make zackbot work, so thanks for that. Plus, if I offer a VC you’re usually one of the first ones up for it if it’s a good time for you.
                <br/><br/>
                Ventis – from the little bit of talking to you I’ve done you’re a pretty cool person too, it’s fun to watch you freak out over something that happens in Danganronpa.
                <br/><br/>
                ZaCH – You’re a pretty big fucking goon but otherwise you’re alright
                <br/><br/>
                Any_key14 – Without you I wouldn’t have liked Otso or HoI4, so thanks for that my friendo. Also, I’m honestly real sorry for not working on the beats for First Strike, I’ve got mock exams all the fucking time and the little bit of time I get in between is not enough to work on anything. Also I need some good ass software which doesn’t have me pay 29.99 for a guitar noise.
                <br/><br/>
                Zoi – from the tiny bit I’ve talked to you, you come across as a spontaneous person, which honestly isn’t that bad.
                <br/><br/>
