                <p>
                    Where do I even start? I have, by no means, the shared history and culture surrounding this
                    phenomenon of yours. You could call me a member, sure. I, however, didn’t know what an Aegwynn
                    even was until a couple of hours ago as of the time of writing. I didn’t know what Zion did, I
                    didn’t know about the real relationships that happened because of the server. They say ignorance
                    is bliss, but why does knowledge make me feel so much happier now?

                <p>
                    You all know this already, but I hail from a humble cyber-place we call Solstice. Solstice, which
                    began as the Todd Howard Fan Club, began in response to self-determination amongst a subset of those
                    who frequented DDFC-- much like the OVA, I’d imagine. There has always existed, I believe, a
                    fundamental difference; I always felt more emotions involved with the denizens of the OVA than with
                    my own Solstice.

                <p>
                    So, with such a long-winded exposition, I must have a quite the follow-up, huh? Possibly, if you’re
                    too sentimental for your own good (like myself). After finishing the first session of a group play
                    of Despair Girls with two of my friends from school, finding a website apparently created for this
                    server’s birthday was, suffice to say, intriguing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can’t explain it. Reading the entries on this site, I felt something well up inside me. Here was
                    a group of people who had no clue as to the existence of each other before a year ago. Despite that,
                    you all expressed the feelings you’d had and the memories you had made over the Internet. I read
                    about the trust you placed in others, and the support you offered in return. I read about the
                    investments you made in personalities conveyed over text on a screen. I was moved by how people who
                    have not and probably never will meet each other in real life can happen upon each other by some of
                    life's countless infinitesimally unlikely chances and forge relationships over the Internet.

                <p>
                    I am not a man of faith, philosophy, or theology. Before being pressured, perchance, into playing
                    some offensively bright pastel-colored electronic picture book, before I joined some silly chat room
                    and spent an ungodly amount of time there, and before I picked up new interests that led me to new
                    skills and perspectives on the world I trudge through, I was turning into something of a misanthrope.
                    I doubted the value my companions placed on my relationship with them, and didn’t trust that they
                    would be there for me if I needed it. I sometimes still find myself wanting to think like that. I
                    doubted my capabilities and fell into a slump where my grades suffered with my physical well-being.
                    I doubted a future that had me in it.

                    There’s a phrase I liked to toss around every once in a while, and any Solstice folks reading this
                    should recognize this one: “people suck.” People don’t suck. People aren’t insufferable by their
                    nature; people only want to live their lives as the star of their own personal movie. When these
                    protagonists seek to be a part of something bigger - a Wonder of the Ancient World, a series of
                    protests aimed at injustices like climate change or marginalization, or even being the highlight of
                    someone’s day despite not knowing their name or what they look like - that is where humanity shines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t want to shut myself in and away from people, not anymore. I’ve been living as a hypocrite to
                    myself for too much of my life in believing that I am not a people person. Opening up to, and being
                    able to place trust in, other people-- that is what gives life any meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this scrying deeper into myself than I ever planned? Yes. Will nearly as many people as I hope
                    see this? Definitely not. Is this whole thing going overboard? Absolutely. I’m not worried about
                    that, however. Just knowing that I was able to express how I feel about this peculiar situation, and
                    about all of your situations, is beyond exciting. I don’t plan on quitting Solstice or the OVA
                    anytime soon, but if they disappeared while I slept tonight, I am still walking away with experiences
                    and memories I’ll treasure at least until I’m old enough to drink.

                    If there is any takeaway from my wall of text-- for me or for you -it is the goodness of people and
                    the wonder of cosmic accidents. Everything about your life and mine as they are now are miracles for
                    turning out to be that way, because the unlikelihood of the choices we made to get here are
                    cosmically great. You don’t know me, and I don’t know you, but thank you. The Internet is a pretty
                    nifty thing, huh?
