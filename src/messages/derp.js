                So I know I haven’t been around a lot recently, and I’ve been lurking a lot more.
                But I just wanted to say thanks to y’all. You all took me in as the first community I wanted to be
                in and others wanted me to be in too. Before then I kinda drifted through different games and
                communities without much to it, it was kinda lonely. I was introduced to DDLC back in September
                and met y’all in November, and wow. You all have always been fun loving friends that have good
                taste in fun shite. I know I have been stupid, annoying and weird in the past year but you all
                welcome me with open arms regardless, and I cannot tell you how much that means to me. Y’all be
                the best you know, despite how little I post in classrooms I still like to hang round with y’all.
                Even with the other things I ended up joining over time I kinda have left those to go back to just
                my good friends, which are y’all.
                <br/><br/>
                Supa you’ve been fricking awesome to chat with over the past year, also you’ve got good taste in
                Waifus. Especially the Purple haired ones.
                <br/><br/>
                Mute you’ve been really nice to me, and even though you didn’t need to you came to check on me in
                a couple of situations and that means ZA WARUDO to me.
                <br/><br/>
                Saag you’ve been an awesome friend, even though we’ve chatted less recently it’s still awesome
                that I got to meet you in person.
                <br/><br/>
                TBH all of y’all have been awesome. Im glad to have had so many experiences with y’all, especially
                last December. You all mean a lot to me, I’m glad to have met ya!
