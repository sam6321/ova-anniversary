                So I know I’m late, I thought I wouldn’t write one since I probably wouldn’t be able to think of
                anything anyways. But I suppose I’ll try. I did send a message to my closest friends on here, which are
                Sayo, Deelon and Tyler. And I’m not going to share those or make a list of people and what i think of
                them cause, well that’s just something I wouldn’t do because I’d end up feeling bad for everyone I’d
                leave out and I’m lazy so that feeling combined with laziness means I’d be writing something for
                everyone and I don’t feel like doing that.

                Last December was really fun for me, meeting new people on discord. Many many memes and other fun
                things, that month felt like a really cozy and weird month and I’m not sure if I’ll experience a feeling
                like it again.

                Anyways, I’ve had a really bad year. It wasn’t fun, it wasn’t happy. I had trouble with school, myself
                and a multitude of other things. You know how in your teen years they usually say you like realise who
                you are and stuff, and well I think I finally know now. And I know what and who I don’t want to be. It
                all started after my internship ended in January that’s essentially where it went downhill for me. But
                despite this I’ve still had some pretty good experiences with all of you and I want to thank the people
                who didn’t give up on me and didn’t mind the bullshit I sometimes pulled.
                <br/><br/>
                In the end I decided to quit school, close some other parts of my life that hurt a lot and now I’m
                finally ready to become the person who I want to be and work for a better future. So uh thanks for
                reading my thing.
