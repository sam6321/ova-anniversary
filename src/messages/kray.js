                Okay so I know this is extremely fucking late. Mostly because I couldn't decide how I wanted to say this and because I'm lazy.
                <br/>
                1 year of this server. Despite some of the shitty drama and problems we've gone through, we fucking made it. Congrats us.
                <br/>
                I also tend to get really formal when I get serious, so bear with me.
                <br/>
                I never expected myself to be pulled into a commmunity like this. Seems like lots of my friendships are happy accidents as I like to call them. But that's fine.
                <br/>
                Life is unexpected, and this was probably one of the least expected things we've ever experienced. I attempt to avoid showing my more feelsy, sensitive side.
                <br/>
                It's just something I got used to. I find it hard to open up to others.
                <br/>
                But this server is different. It's so much easier to talk about problems. When worst comes to worst, I see other members helping other members. I see people open up
                <br/>
                in a way I would never find elsewhere on the Internet, which is often just shitposting and cancer galore.
                <br/>
                I know I often don't help people with those issues. That's just a problem with me. I feel like I'm pretty horrible at helping others with their problems. But I can feel
                how tightly knit this community is. While not all things may be permanent, I never want to see this server die. If the server must go, our relationships should not.
                <br/>
                It especially helped maintain my sanity in spring this year. I was pretty depressed at the time and this server was a good way to get away from life.
                <br/>
                This is the only time I have sincerely cared about relationships over the Internet. Other times I will usually reject further development of the
                relationship out of mistrust and paranoia. I think it's a massive achievement.
                <br/>
                As much as I may shit on everyone in classroom, as much as I may deport Snow to Siberia or put spiders in the chat, I care about everyone here.
                <br/><br/>
                Any: Cool guy. One of the few I can talk about history/politics to, which is something I'm very passionate about. It's always great to find people like that.
                One of the meme mans of the server. Godspeed to you. Again, life is unexpected. Who knows, maybe you'll find someone in the next several years. I hope you do.
                <br/><br/>
                Cake: When we meet up I'm shooting an arrow into your knee. You're really neato though.
                <br/><br/>
                Cal: Also very cool. It's always great when you decide to organise a community event. Not so great when another Ty x something fic gets published (ty x spiders when).
                I can't say much about physical self-image, because I've never particularly cared about my own. I wish you luck with your goals nevertheless. Others are here to pull
                you through.
                <br/><br/>
                Cell: I still need to convert you to the communist ideology. That being said, you're still a chill and understanding guy at the end of the day.
                <br/><br/>
                Dee: I'm sometimes impressed at how put together some people seem to be. It doesn't have to be picture perfect. I definitely admire that aspect about you.
                Converted to an S;G fan, with my full seal of approval. Long live comrade Stalin and good luck with your future.
                <br/><br/>
                Dou: Our interests might not align that much, but you like Persona, which is an instant plus in my book. I know you've got a bunch of shit raining on your head. I know what
                shit luck feels like, even if it may not be as bad as your situation. Try to find a place to vent troubles, hold your head up high. I have faith in you.
                <br/><br/>
                Mute: Meltdown DW when
                Also you're cool.
                <br/><br/>
                Nee: Fellow S;G fan, that was a pleasant surprise. You're cool in my books.
                <br/><br/>
                Sayo: My fucking :b:. Puts up with me failing Big Bank 5000 times (I finished it though so I declare myself fully not gay). We still need to finish kiss the chef.
                I won't fuck up next time I stg. We better be :b:s for a damn long time.
                <br/><br/>
                Snow: I'm waiting for 200 snowcaps. North Korean spy and communist traitor. I don't have much of an appreciation for visual art (unless it's fanart of something I'm into)
                but you're pretty good at drawing. I don't understand how someone can have such bad luck (I wish that on no one jfc), but maybe one day the lord Christ will come down to
                correct all this bullshit. Good luck to you, and try your best to pull through high school. I'm warning ya, it's only getting rougher from here on out. We'll all be here
                at the end of the day though if it becomes too much.
                <br/><br/>
                Supa: I'm amazed at how much this server has helped with your emotional state as a whole. You're also very cool (Halo is fucking great). Good luck with your future.
                <br/><br/>
                Ty: Stop beating yourself up smh. Comrade Stalin does not benefit from that. You need to be alive to serve communism (and yourself). Also I need to make a folder for
                your screencaps. I hope you're mentally prepared.
                <br/><br/>
                Vase: Ultra meme man and suffered with me through the no damns for a week challenge. Very cool guy.
                <br/><br/>
                Even if I didn't list you, know that you have made some difference in my life. It might just be the fact that I'm hyper fucking lazy or don't know what else to say.
                See you all again in about 358 days. It's back to communism mode for me.
