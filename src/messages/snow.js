                truly be myself towards. IK I may be a sort of pain in the ASK KETCHUM, but I hope that I also was
                well rad for you all too. I’m very grateful to know you all for a year and get o hang out with you
                all for the many more/few to come!

                Kray: the trolling person himself. Aside from that, you’re a really really smart guy who knows his
                stuff and works hard and is really rad with video games. Even if you trolled me a lot, I still
                think of you as a cool friend that I do enjoy talking with.
                <br/><br/>

                mature guy who handles things with common sense and you’re really strong with dealing with any kind
                of problem and put your head up high. You’re really cool too with edits you make and making chiaki

                talking to you when you’re online since you bring up such random but good convo topics. And ik you
                always say you’re rude to everyone and yadda yadda, but you are genuinely a very caring person and
                you’re a really great owner too keeping things organized plus having fun yourself. I hope things

                self-deprecate, Ik you don’t like me doing it, but I honestly don’t like it when you do it too.

                others too. I very much so enjoy your company and you make cool edits and like idk you’re a great

                And finally<br/><br/>
                *deep breaths*<br/><br/>
                Sayo: okay okay this might take a lot of writing and there will be a bunch of text but here goes nothing<br/>
                You were my first friend from the OVA and the one and only person I ever felt something different for. Knowing you for a year feels so wild and cool af as time goes by fast, like hella fast. I was just and am, well I felt some big connection towards you. I was an idiot not knowing it was love and had like the biggest crush on you. After the whole “trap” fiasco I was so happy to well finally tell you about my feelings and I just never ever felt so happy knowing that you shared the same feelings as I did for you. Finally asking you out (“hEy ArE wE dAtInG :0) it just ahhh I felt like a lot of fireworks exploded like BOOM POW BOOM---- of happiness that is dw dw I was totes fine. Even if it was awkward from the start, our relationship and bond got stronger and stronger and I never ever felt so much happier before. You were always there for me no matter what and I never felt lonely and you always cared about me and in an instant knew if something was wrong or if I was upset and stuff. Even if we had problems and drama here and there, we still made up about a day later and still were strong together. I never felt this way for someone or felt this happy or well felt like I could ever trust someone this much ever before. I really trust you and am willing to die for you. Like legit no joke i would do anything for you, Sayo. I know over time it kinda got sorta awkward with us not really talking as much as we used to before, but we’re still great and all that! I really really really care about you and love you a lot like no one has before yes. You mean so much to me.. and well that’s why I’m such a big idiot tbh. I legit.. am gonna say a bad word—am an asshole to you a lot and that’s the truth. I keep taking advantage of you and out of nowhere just be a complete piece of shit for no reason and act hostile for no reason. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but yeah I’m just stupid and I’m sorry for that. I’m honestly surprised you still handle me even when I’m like the worst person who could ever exist.. and that just… makes me feel so… just happy since you still stick with me no matter what even after me being such a complete jerk. I couldn’t thank you enough, I appreciate everything you did for me from the bottom of my heart and I hope I can be there for you to, to care about you, to just talk to you and remind you of how much of an amazing, smart, caring, beautiful person you are. Thank you.<br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
