                I'm gonna try to keep this short even though I know it's gonna end up the length of an essay.
                A little over a year ago I bailed from DDFC because the community was split in several different
                directions from Sayori Hangout, to Minori's Kingdom, to plenty of other servers. And while I was
                invited to most of these servers, I never really interacted in them for whatever reason.
                I didn't have a group to talk to anymore. But with you guys I felt something, something that the
                other servers lacked. I still don't know what it is, gonna be honest. But I just liked being
                around you guys more then the other servers. There was more heart and soul with you guys.
                The VCs were great and I felt actual connections with you guys.
                <br/><br/>
                You all took me in when I had no group anymore, and it was great knowing that I actually had a
                group now. Knowing that I have a group of people that I can honestly call friends is great.
                Knowing I have a group of people to share my interests with. Like with the Pokemon Tourneys, DnD,
                and very soon making Youtube Videos. I've been able to share my love for these things and not worry
                about being judged or anything like that. I'm able to come here and talk about problems I'm going
                through. I'm able to be me in ova, and I've never been able to be like that before. I'm always
                wearing a mask, if that makes sense. I even love doing stuff for you guys whenever I end up doing
                stuff, whether it's something small like the list of usable Pokemon in certain tourneys whenever it
                was somewhat vague back when we did those, or something as big and time-consuming as making several
                guides for DnD and a whole new DnD story with unique enemies, bosses, and mechanics, then DMing
                that same story. It's all fulfilling to me. It makes me feel like I'm actually doing something with my life.
                <br/><br/>
                Throughout the year, we've had great times, but not without some bad times. We've had both really
                high highs, and really low lows. You all know what I'm talking about. The people that will go
                un-named. Yea, you know. Anyway, what I mean is that even through the shitty times, we've stuck
                together as a group. We may have lost a few people here and there, but they all had a reason
                (or was banned), but these things happen.
                <br/><br/>
                Basically what I'm saying, is I fucking love you guys. All of you mean the world to me and I'd give
                my life for you niggas if that situation ever arised, and that's not the hating life part of me
                talking. That's the human part of me talking. You all seriously are my fucking world now, not gonna
                lie. I'm bored? Go to ova. Got a problem? Go to ova. Got a question? Go to ova. Wanna talk about
                something? Go the fuck to ova. So I'll say it now until the day I die. I love you guys. If possible,
                I'd love to do some more VCs since Winter Break is coming up. I remember back during the early days
                when like everyday we'd all be in VC for like 12 hours. Those were some good times.
                <br/><br/>
                Let's hope for another great year.
