                Dear OVA,
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I just want to say thank you to each of you for being part of my life for the last year.
                I know I would be significantly worse off if I hadn't met all of you.
                Thank you for being alive, and thank you for making my life and the lives of everyone else on this server significantly better.
                I don't want to lose any of you, ever.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Deelon
            </p>
        );
