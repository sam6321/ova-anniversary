                Well where do I even start with this one. It’s hard to put this into words but it’s been a year
                alright. I just gotta say you guys are some of the greatest people i know. You’re all just so
                damn helpful and funny and supportive and just really chill and great to be around. I’d be lying
                if I didn’t say all of you have actually changed my entire life. And I mean ALL OF YOU, don’t you
                dare sell yourself short. Whether I just want a casual conversation, some laughs, to play some games,
                or I just need some support on a bad day, you all are always there. Except when its 2am and chat is
                dead. It’s really hard to keep coming up with things to say because my brain is basically turned off
                and i’ve got no clue. But I hope everyone understands how much they mean to me. The biggest reason
                I’m having trouble writing this is because y’all are distracting me right the fuck now as I type
                this so let that speak for itself. I don’t know what I’d do without all of you, you’re all just
                simply so fantastic. I’ve spoken a lot before on how I’ve had some really shitty experiences with
                “friends.” For nearly 2 whole years after that, I’ve had terrible doubts and trust issues. For
                more than I’d like to admit even after joining OVA, I would be afraid people just secretly hated me,
                just pitied me and used me, I used to be nearly obsessively active in chat because i feared if i
                started appearing just a little less, people would just forget about me. Now, after a whole year in
                OVA, those thoughts and fears and doubts are just gone. Completely gone. I simply haven’t felt that
                way in months. I think that just goes to show how amazing and great and supportive you’ve all been
                to me. Just talking to you guys helps me through some tough stuff and makes my day better and
                I really, REALLY, just want everybody to know it too.

                Well I’ve had a fun little ramble, here's to another year of brilliant bullshit with my bestest buds.
