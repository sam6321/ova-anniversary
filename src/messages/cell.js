                So it's hard to believe it's been a year since OVA formed. I would love to write individual points about you all but I'd be typing for hours on end and probably driving myself crazy with it. So I'm just going to write a general message.
                <br/><br/>
                Ever since the beginning I always felt a connection to all of you. You're all unique and amazing people even if you guys think otherwise about yourselves.
                <br/><br/>
                All the vcs, games we've played, fan fics we've read I'll never forget and I'll always cherish those memories. This server has definitely had its ups and downs but seeing as we're still here shows how strong our bonds are between us. It's amazing to see all of the support you guys give me and each other in someone's time of need.
                <br/><br/>
                I'm gonna be honest, when I first joined the server I was in a really bad place mentally. I was really depressed and hopeless but I found comfort and solace in talking with such great people. And eventually you guys brought me up to the point where I was able to take on the issues I was facing and I couldn't be anymore thankful for that.
                <br/><br/>
                I know I'm not here as often as I used to but I still hold you all close to my heart and I'm always here to talk and offer a helping hand when I can.
                <br/><br/>
                Sometimes it's hard to believe that we're all here because of a game we played. If I had never played DDLC I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet you guys and have the experiences I've had and will have with you all. And I'm forever grateful I played DDLC and met such great people.
                <br/><br/>
                And to finish this, I wanted to thank Tyler for not only being a wonderful owner of the server but a wonderful owner of my heart and I love you so much. You're the greatest girlfriend ever and meeting you was the one of the best things that has ever happened in my life.
                <br/><br/>
                You're all wonderful and amazing people and each and every one of you better not forget that. So here's to another year of OVA, I love you all
