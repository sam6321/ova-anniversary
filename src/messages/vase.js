                        I can't really put my feelings about you all into words, cause I'm not good at conveying my
                        emotions and especially considering my three word vocabulary. But I only really need those
                        three words. I damn love y'all (fuck you tyler here you go) and you're really cool and epic.
                        I've kinda been here from the start but I also only started talking regularly in late
                        January/early February.  I can safely say this is the server I've been active for the longest
                        time in and I hope both this server and I will stay active for far longer. Uh, I can't really
                        say much more than „y'all cool“ because I'm a dumbass but I genuinely do love you OVA people
                        (no homo though (maybe a bit)). bye
