                So this server's been around for a year. Neato. Guess I'll write something for the 3 people that
                would read this. OVA has been an... interesting time, to say the least. It gave me a safe haven
                from the shit show that was DDFC, but I still ended up leaving because my depression twisting my
                thoughts. Regardless of that, I've still met a bunch of amazingly cool guys and gals here.
                <br/><br/>
                Monado, Supa, Mute, Sayo, and Cal, who I've played many a Terraria with and beated some bullshit with.
                <br/><br/>
                Snow, who's always trying her hardest to draw very good art for me, even if I feel bad every time I ask.
                <br/><br/>
                Cake, Ty, Vase, Any, Cell, Ventis, Deelon, and Kray who've always given me some laughs while being here.
                <br/><br/>
                Derp and Monica (and other people that I've mentioned already), who help me out when I'm feeling down.
                <br/><br/>
                And last but not least, my amazing boyfriend Saag, who I cannot thank enough for all the love and support he brings me every day.
                <br/><br/>
                While I have trust issues thanks to DDFC, I feel like OVA is a place where I can actually be myself
                and be accepted here. Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart, and I hope this discord won't be nuked again lol.
